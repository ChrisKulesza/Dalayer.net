    "Description": "Hi.\n \nThank you for Simple OOXML.\n \nI would like the ability to convert an existing excel (.xls) file to open xml format.\n \nIs this on the roadmap?\n \nI found this project that is able to read and write to excel (.xls) files without Excel that I am hoping efforts can be combined to integrate the two solutions.\n \nExcelLibrary\nhttp://code.google.com/p/excellibrary/\n(formerly ExcelReader)\n \nI have already made a post on http://code.google.com/p/excellibrary/wiki/ImplementingOpenXmlSupport to make them aware of this project.\n \nThank you.",
