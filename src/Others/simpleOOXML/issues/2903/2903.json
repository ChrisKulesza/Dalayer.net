      "Message": "I can confirm the behaviour described above by beaunidle. Trying to achieve the same goal, I also noticed that trying to write boolean values from an SQL Server database into an Excel 2007 sheet (by inserting a DataTable object, using the InsertDataTable method) results in a corrupted xlsx file. Excel is able to fix the problem on opening the file, but I feel this is not a behaviour to be desired. The DataTable is filled by a SQL statement, no LINQ to SQL.\r\n\r\nSimple OOXML is a good library to work with; much more intuitive than the OXML SDK. Good job!",
