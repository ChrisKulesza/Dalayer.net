I did a solution wide find/replace for NumberFormat to NumberingFormat, and then fixed the few instances (12) where NumberFormatId got changed to NumberingFormatId, as well as ApplyNumberFormat (two) got changed to ApplyNumberingFormat. All unit tests passed after these changes, and my project compiled fine with the Dec CTP and the newly compiled extensions DLL.</p>",
